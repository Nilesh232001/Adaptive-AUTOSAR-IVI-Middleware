# Adaptive AUTOSAR IVI Middleware

This project demonstrates a modular, service-oriented IVI middleware using vsomeip for SOME/IP communication, Qt for GUI, and JSON for state persistence.

## Components
- Media Service
- Navigation Service
- Climate Service
- Qt-based HMI

Each service runs as a separate process and communicates using SOME/IP.
